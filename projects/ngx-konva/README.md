# ngx-konva

This library provides you simple Angular bindings for [KonvaJS](https://konvajs.org/). This is still a work in progress and not an official release of Konva framework. PRs and contributions are more than welcome.

This project is inspired by the more official library [n2-konva](https://github.com/konvajs/ng2-konva) that, as for now, seems not to be maintaned.
